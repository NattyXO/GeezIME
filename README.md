# Introduction

The purpose of the Able GeezIME project is to provide a cost free, easy to use, linguistically supported, disabled people considerate and standard compliant input method editor to the society that uses the Geez writing system.
Although further dedicated work and time is required to achieve the above mentioned goals to their fullest, a significant result has already been attained, making it possible to put together an enhanced release of the software to the general public.
